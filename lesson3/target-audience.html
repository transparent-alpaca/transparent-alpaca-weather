                -	<strong>Occupation:</strong> BYU-I student, semi-professional skier. His uncle Ron is kind of a big deal in the news world.<br>
                -	<strong>Age:</strong> 23 years old.<br>
                -	<strong>Motivation for using the website:</strong> He is constantly monitoring if it is snowing in the mountains, how much snow has fallen/is falling, and what the temperature outside is so he can go skiing with his friends.<br>
                -	<strong>Social:</strong> Owns an Instagram account with more than 7.5k followers who are interested in this sport and his personal feats. Many people know him and is very socially active.<br>
                -	<strong>Technology:</strong> He uses a laptop for his BYU-I classes, and his iPhone and Apple Watch outside because it helps him track his physical activity, receive notifications, and track the weather in his current location.<br>
                -	<strong>Quote:</strong> “Gravity and snow are your friends, but if you don’t know how to use them, they’ll turn on you.”<br>

                -	<strong>Occupation:</strong> Stay-at-home grandma.<br>
                -	<strong>Age:</strong> 70 years old.<br>
                -	<strong>Motivation for using the website:</strong> She has a 4-year-old Labrador with a lot of energy that loves to go outside for walks, but she cannot stand temperatures lower than 40 degrees. She is interested in having an easy way to know if it is cold or warm outside to take her dog out for a daily walk.<br>
                -	<strong>Social:</strong> She spends most of her time at home with her dog and her retired husband Fred, and goes to play bingo on the weekends with her friends Rhonda, Ethel, and Edna.<br>
                -	<strong>Technology:</strong> She has a desktop computer that her grandson gave her for her 65th birthday, she uses it to read the news, watch comedy videos on YouTube, and has recently discovered the marvels of Skype. It will be useful for her to check the weather daily as well.<br>
                -	<strong>Quote:</strong> “I’m cold. Put your sweater on.”<br>

            -	<strong>Scenario 3:</strong> I will be traveling tomorrow. What will the weather be in the city I am visiting?<br>
            -	<strong>Scenario 4:</strong> I need a website that is easy to read and easy to understand.<br>
            -	<strong>Scenario 5:</strong> Will I get accurate information on this website?
